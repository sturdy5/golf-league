This application is a golf league management project. The application is primarly written in PHP and Javascript. This is an evolving solution to a golf league that had been previously doing everything through excel spreadsheets and email.

- Adding players as fulltime or subs
- Creating notifications on the main page
- Admin login
- Member login
- Schedule display
- Ability to request a sub through the site
- Support for team based and individual play
- Automatic hole assignment

The following is a list of functionality that does not exist:
- Handicap calculations
- Adding a course or a set of courses
- Creating a season that lands on a day other than a Thursday
- Changing hole assignments on the fly
- Changing course side on the fly
